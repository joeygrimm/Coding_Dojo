    <p>Hi there! My name is Joey Grimm and I am 31 years old. I reside in Shawnee, KS with my beautiful wife and three children. I am jack of many trades. One of those trades is woodworking, which I hope to master one day. My love for woodworking began when I started a door refinishing business in 2011. This entailed taking down the weather doors, chemically stripping the wooden door, sanding them, and adding finish. I absoluted loved the process of making the wood look new again, and the reactions I would get from my customers. That business was the spring board, which lauched me down the rabbit hole of woodworking. Come explore this trade with me, by following my blog.</p>

      <h3>Where do I buy these tools and get materials?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>See, it doesn't take very many tools to get started in woodworking. You may be asking yourself on where you could go to pickup your tools and to purchase materials for your next project. I couldn't tell you for sure on, where to go because it all depends on your preferences and what stores are available in your area. However, I will post a table below with a few stores that are common throughout the United States, which means it could be close to you.</p>
